# ðŸ’Ž Ruby on Rails API Boilerplate
This repository serves as a boilerplate for my personal Ruby on Rails projects. It provides a solid foundation with essential features to streamline development and ensure best practices. I use this setup regularly as it helps me kickstart projects quickly while maintaining a high standard of quality.

## Features
- Endpoints with grape cover with tests
- Models cover with tests
- Services cover with tests
- Workers using sidekiq cover with tests
- Mailer
- Error handler
- Initial seed
- Demo rake task
- Docker integration
- Swagger

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation
1. Replace all matches with `RAILS_API_BOILERPLATE`, `rails_api_boilerplate`,  `RailsApiBoilerplate` and `rails-api-boilerplate` to desired name 
2. Create a ```.env``` file in the root of your project by copying the ```.env.example``` file. Edit the newly created ```.env``` file to include your Telegram bot token and any other necessary configuration variables.
3. Run:
```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
